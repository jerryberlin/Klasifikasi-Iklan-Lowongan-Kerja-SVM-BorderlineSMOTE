Right now we are a team of 3. We launched on 6/12 with our first paying customer, a mid-market investment bank in Chicago, and are now looking to build out our team.ProductClearNDA aims to securely bring contract negotiations to the cloud.The product was originally developed to address the challenges faced by investment banks executing a high volume of non-disclosure agreements, but ClearNDA can increase speed and decrease risk associated with contract negotiations of all types.When negotiating legal agreements we found that there were often version control issues and there is no certainty that there has been no document tampering. This problem was magnified when dealing with multiple documents across multiple organizations. We built a product to minimize risk, reduce the time people spend on tedious work, and maximize the speed at which deals are executed.Why Us?ClearNDA/ClearContract is solving the problem of contract negotiation and execution through a secure platform that enables companies and individuals to create, distribute, negotiate and sign contracts in a wide variety of contexts.We are still very early stage, so new employees can expect to have a lot of autonomy, influence over the business, and an ownership stake. That said, we are much more than just an idea on the back of a napkin. We have recently launched with our first paying customer, a mid-market investment bank in Chicago. Our target customers are investment banks, commercial real estate brokerages, and law firms, and we anticipate that each new customer will net $10-100k in revenue.

There aren’t many people like you; just people who want to be like you. You know you’re talented, because you’re data driven and the results are on your side. But you’re also humble, and you’re looking to focus your talents on something you believe in. You have a history of growing user bases because you simply find a way to make things happen. You have a special skill for planning, but a scorn for using it. You are driven by a plan, but not led by it. You have a bias for immediate action and an uncanny instinct for channeling it effectively. Tomorrow is too late; yesterday is always on time. Your success may have come while running a single website business or from delivering exceptional results within an agency or corporate environment.

You will design and implement A/B tests and other analytical frameworks for your campaigns. We wouldn’t be surprised if you put your technical skills to use to write a few lines of code that help you implement campaigns and better understand the results.But unlike any other such roles you’ve heard of, you will also use your smarts, and your proven entrepreneurial spirit, to make things happen. Your disdain for meetings and heavy bias towards action will move the company forward. You will go rogue because you have the wherewithal to act on proven instinct without anyone or anything getting in your way. Time is not your friend, urgency is your default, and action is your north star.You love our customers. You want to share our products with them because of how helpful they will be. You wake up every morning overwhelmed at the thought of ensuring enough people take advantage of what CommonBond has to offer. Feeling overwhelmed drives you, rather than paralyzes you. In support of your acquisition goals, you will: Develop a roadmap for identifying, testing, and optimizing new channels.Analyze and report on all marketing programs with focus on ROI optimization.Work with design and production team to develop marketing units, ads, emails and collateral.Above all, results will determine your success. You’ll need only enough analysis and reporting to demonstrate the success you’re driving in the business. Bachelor’s degree.Demonstrated track record of increasing acquisition numbers and executing successful campaigns.Experience with some or all of the following:  Adwords, Bing, Facebook ads, Twitter ads, LinkedIn ads, A/B testing software (e.g., Optimizely), and ESPs (e.g. MailChimp).Experience building reports, analyzing campaign data, and quickly learning as we grow.Demonstrated ability to thrive in a fast paced, rapidly changing environment.Strong written/oral communication skills, with an ability to create order and flexible processes when needed.Entrepreneurial, responsible, self-motivated, upbeat team player.Creative thinker and resourceful problem solver.Eye for designSome experience with a programming language is a plus.

0,1,1,"Intern - Building and Sustainability Analyst   SHS was the first Community Interest Company to be certified as a Green Deal Assessor Organisation. This allows our qualified Green Deal Advisors to undertake and lodge Green Deal Assessment Reports, complete ECO assessments and Energy Performance Certificates.The quality control systems and technical knowledge underpin our screening survey operations and proprietary software. Along with our area based stock screening approach, this service pre-qualifies households prior to a full assessment.Our experience in working with over 3,000 households highlighted the importance of ECO grants in creating attractive propositions for households. Although we are able to offer stand-alone Green Deal Assessment Reports, we would normally work with clients to target high potential ECO areas. The Role:SHS is seeking a Junior Building and Sustainability Analyst with a strong interest in energy efficiency and sustainable homes. After a successful probation period (one month), the successful candidate will be offered a full-time role and officially trained as a Domestic Energy Assessor by an accredited organisation. This training will allow you to systematically carry out detailed on-site home energy efficiency and renewable energy assessments, making impartial recommendations on cost effective home improvements and behavioural change.Initially you will be trained internally to analyse buildings in order to determine their existing energy efficiency and whether they have had any sustainability work already done to them. At present this is focused predominantly around wall insulation however this may change as government policy and funding changes. This analysis will be split between desktop analysis, using various in-house and common-use internet tools and on-site analysis where you will initially shadow and learn from our experienced building surveyors.In addition to this building analysis, if desired you can also be exposed to and trained in detailed data analysis of carbon savings using Excel. This raw data is obtained from energy efficiency surveys and analysis is required in order to report on a property's carbon savings potential and therefore its potential value to our business. You will be a hard working and diligent individual who is comfortable working at speed with good accuracy. You should be a fast learner who is as comfortable working in a team as individually. You will be working in a team of experienced people who are happy to pass on their knowledge so you should feel confident in asking questions where required as well as inputting ideas where appropriate. You will ideally have knowledge and reasonable experience in the use of Excel (some knowledge in the use of pivot tables and regression analysis tools would be beneficial for the data analysis but this is not crucial as it can be taught). Knowledge of domestic energy efficiency is also an advantage but not essential as SHS provides the necessary training.Desired background:You should hold a degree (2.1 or higher) from a recognised university, ideally in a related course (e.g. Building Services, Sustainability, Surveying, Renewable Energy, Maths / Science)You should have a genuine interest in sustainability, environmental solutions or community engagementNumerate with good analytical skillsPossess an understanding of Excel and data analysisExcellent oral and written communication skills (fluency in English essential)Good organisational and time management skillsStrong interpersonal skills, with the ability to build and maintain productive relationshipsAbility to work independently, taking initiative and ‘ownership’ of assignmentsHold a full, clean UK driver's licence Candidate Benefits:This is a fantastic opportunity to join an entrepreneurial, fast-growing and dynamic organisation and work with them to become the leader in their field and potentially grow into new areas moving forward. It would really suit a hard-working, analytical individual who is interested in sustainability and excited by the prospect of working for a young, thriving organisation. As part of the team, you will gain a wider knowledge in sustainable solutions, particularly the cost-benefit implications of energy efficiency measurements and renewable energy technologies. Furthermore you will get an insight into environmental policies and the current government schemes. Finally you will gain experience and a deeper understanding of community-engagement strategies, collective thinking and what factors influence decision making within a community. Due to the nature of our parent company (Sustainable Ventures Development Partners) you will also be exposed to our other sustainable businesses that all work from the same office and potentially get the opportunity to add insight to them as they grow. These include eCar, Powervault, Canary Controls and Autotrip. Full-time Bachelor's Degree Renewables & Environment Data Analyst",0

0,1,0,"Innovation Fund Associate   The vast majority of product and service ideas generated by university research are never realized because they are too early stage to attract investment. The University of Chicago is building an array of programs to create the kind of entrepreneurial ecosystem that can overcome this hurdle to commercialization. These include the establishment of the Chicago Innovation Exchange and the innovation campus being built on 53rd street, the D4Lab and D4Fellows programs, The New Venture Challenge, multiple new early stage accelerators, and the expansion of the Innovation Fund. The Innovation Fund, a philanthropic proof-of-concept fund, was created in order to give early stage, research driven ideas a chance. By applying commercial discipline and supplying focused pre-commercial seed funding, its goal is to shepherd these technologies along a commercial path and cultivate a community of early stage innovators and entrepreneurs connected to the University. In collaboration with a variety of Divisions and centers on campus at the University of Chicago, the Innovation Fund Associates Program (IFAP) will triage and review innovative projects by entities affiliated with the University (e.g., faculty discovery, including the Institute for Molecular Engineering, the Institute for Translational Medicine, etc., as well as Argonne National Laboratory). Once each project is assigned to a team, Associates will, at a minimum, prepare projects for funding consideration, aid in the establishment of milestones, coordinate and conduct a variety of due diligence analyses, and organize monthly oversight meetings. In addition, the Associates are to be active participants in the projects, providing resource and expertise where needed. The IF Associate University Teams will draw from the diverse set of constituencies at the University. Students pursuing undergraduate or graduate studies are welcome to apply, provided that the students maintain a high standard of academic performance. Given the rigors and time commitments of the program, students nearing graduation from the University will not be ideal candidates. Each team will be staffed with a diverse set of students, emanating from various Divisions with the University.

After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking!

We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace.

0,1,0,"Agronomic Data Scientist   Working at FBNAt FBN, we put farmers first. For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small. Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings. FBN's primary mission is to provide farmers with an unbiased and independent platform for agricultural analytics, using proprietary models based on ground truth data, satellite imagery, weather models, and the combined experience of our network of farmers. We aim to be a place where farmers can get credible insights on what practices, seeds, and equipment would work best on their farm.We're looking for a mission driven agronomic data scientist with a strong agricultural background to help us extract exciting insights from our vast dataset! ResponsibilitiesOnce you join our team, you will be expected to:Use your understanding of agriculture to guide the analysis of the world's largest agronomic database.Develop predictive analytical models that help solve real-world problems facing farmers.Collaborate with the Product Team to transform your analytics into useful tools for FBN members.Required SkillsYou have years of experience with some of these technologies and systemsDeep understanding of agricultural systems (soil chemistry, plant physiology, entomology, etc.).Deep understanding of statistical modeling concepts.Familiarity with machine learning algorithms.Excellent programming skills (R or Python preferred).Excellent data visualization skills.Experience working with large datasets and big data technologies.Creativity; the ability to develop novel solutions to complex analytic challenges.Demonstrated passion for learning new skills and keeping up with current research.A love for agriculture and the mission of helping farmers.Impeccable verbal and written communication skills.Required Experience:MS or greater in statistics or related discipline with strong demonstrated interest in agriculture; OR MS or greater in agronomy, entomology, plant science, soil science, or related discipline with strong quantitative skills and experience with data analysis.

That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands.

Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.

These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies: DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.  The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter: ""Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door."" ""Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity."" This is what not shared on the JD. ""How you will mature your career."" Job Responsibilities: • For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.
